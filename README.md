# Automation with JavaScript

**Automated test suite with WebDriverIO**

I attached an image which validates the successful execution of all 5 automated tests for the "eMag" test suite.
All 5 tests passed.

**Tests:**

1. should have the correct page title
2. should contain a cart button
3. should open eMag Genius page
4. should open login to my account page
5. should have a functional search

I ran the test using the command: npx wdio run ./wdio.conf.js --spec test2.js in commmand prompt.

**Tests:**

1. should function with a basic search 
2. should be able to filter results by time
3. checks if the title of the webpage is correct
4. finds the "Sign in with Google" button

6. should add items to the cart and proceed to checkout
