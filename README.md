# Automation with JavaScript

**Automated test suite with WebDriverIO**

I attached an image which validates the successful execution of all 5 automated tests for the "eMag" test suite.
All 5 tests passed.

**Tests:**

1. should have the correct page title
2. should contain a cart button
3. should open eMag Genius page
4. should open login to my account page
5. should have a functional search

I ran the test using the command: npx wdio run ./wdio.conf.js --spec test2.js in commmand prompt.

**Automated test suite with Cypress**

**Tests:**

1. should function with a basic search 
2. checks if the title of the webpage is correct
3. finds the "Sign in with Google" button
4. verifies if user can login
5. should add items to the cart and proceed to checkout
6. should show an error message when invalid credentials are entered

I attached images which validate the successful execution of all 6 automated tests.
All 5 tests passed.
