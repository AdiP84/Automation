# Automation

**Automated test suite with WebDriverIO**

- built over Selenium

I attached an image which validates the successful execution of all 5 automated tests for the "eMag" test suite.
All 5 tests passed.

**Tests:**

1. should have the correct page title
2. should contain a cart button
3. should open eMag Genius page
4. should open login to my account page
5. should have a functional search

I ran the test using the command: npx wdio run ./wdio.conf.js --spec test2.js in commmand prompt.
